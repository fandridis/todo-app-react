## Main technologies
- React
- Redux
- Scss

<br />

## Helpful libraries used
- Dayjs: To format times
- React-icons: A bunch of free icons
- Teeheo: A tiny library to generate random numbers,strings,uuids (personally built)
- Fantoastic: A react library to show customizable toasts (personally built)

## What is missing
This application was made in a weekend so there's few things missing.
Firstly, a functionality for restoring TODOs from the history would be great.
Secondly, multiple TODO lists (categories) customly built by the user would be great too.
Lastly, the codebase could use a refactor to keep some places DRY.
